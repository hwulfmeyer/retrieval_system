Jessica Sneed, executive director of the Salvation Army in Glendale: “Nonperishable food is a big one for us, specifically anything related to a traditional or ethnic Thanksgiving meal that we’re able to distribute to families. We also need socks, jackets, gloves, blankets, tarps and umbrellas, so that when people have lost their items in recent sweeps we’re able to replace them. Small-size travel toiletries are very helpful, as well as any food item that can be prepared without access to a stove — like cups of noodles, canned food with pull-tabs that don't need can openers, granola bars, things like that.” glendale-ca.salvationarmy.org 

Annemarie Howse, development coordinator of Good Shepherd Center for Homeless Women & Children in Los Angeles: “We provide housing for up to 93 women and 45 children a night…. We can always use new household items, which would include things like new blankets, sheets, towels, pots, pans, dishes and silverware. We also provide move-out packages to women who move onto permanent housing, so we like to set them up with toasters, coffee makers, things like that. Right now we’re also really needing four or five new youth mattresses.” gschomeless.org

Jonathan Thompson, executive director for Good Seed’s housing services for young adults in Los Angeles: “Our young men can always use new socks and underwear … having a fresh pair is definitely refreshing, right? Hygiene kits are always good, as are school supplies, jackets and sleeping bags. We’re able to take gently used items, as long as it’s clean and in good condition.”
